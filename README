Vagns emacs lisp config files.

Well, not really this is a stripped down version for public
consumption. MORE WILL COME LATER.

Prerequisites

  - Install yasnippet and auto-complete in ~/site-lisp
    (If you install in another place you must call (add-to-list
    'load-path ..) *before* calling vj-load (or vj-init).

If necessary setup exec-path and PATH first:

  ;; Windows example (MSYS-Git has grep.exe and other useful tools)
  (add-to-list 'exec-path "c:/tools/Git/bin" t)
  (setenv "PATH" (concat (getenv "PATH") ";c:\\tools\\Git\\bin"))

After that call vj-load.el

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/emacs-config/")
  (load "vj-load")

to your ~/.emacs (or ~/emacs.d/init.el)


If you do not have a .emacs (or init.el) yet then take a look at the
vj-init.el. This enables you to automtically load hostname and os
specific emacs lisp files. It also makes the customize filename
hostname specific.
